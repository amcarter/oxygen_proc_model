# modeled oxygen dynamics in streams:

# mass balance equation:
# dVC/dt = -(dq_x/dx + dq_y/dy + dq_z/dz) + S
#   V = volume
#   C = concentration
#   q_xyz = mass fluxes due to advective and dispersive transport
#   S = sinks and sources


# Assumptions:
# 1. uniform flow/well mixed:
#   dq_x/dx + dq_y/dy = 0
# Physical processes:####
# Temperature ####
# gas exchange ####
